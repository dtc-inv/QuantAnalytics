\item{x}{xts object of asset(s)}

\item{b}{xts object of benchmark(s)}

\item{rf}{optional xts object of risk-free time-series}

\item{freq}{string return frequency: days, weeks, months, quarters, years}

\item{date_start}{date representing first date. See details.}

\item{date_end}{date representing most recent date. See details.}

\item{eps}{percent of missing values (NAs) to allow, default is 0.05 for 5%.

\value{
list with $x for asset(s), $b for benchmark(s), and $rf if
risk-free is entered.

\description{
Handle combing and cleaning asset, rf, and benchmarks
}
\details{
Utility function to handle common task of needing to line up asset, bench,
  and rf returns. If left `NULL` the `date_start` and `date_end` will
  truncate the data at the most recent common start date and oldest common
  end date. If further truncation is desired dates can be entered to cut the
  time-series accordingly. `eps` sets the bar for how many missing values
  are allowed per column. The default is 5%, if a column has more than 5%
  of the observations are missing the column is removed. Otherwise the
  missing values are filled with zero.

data(assets)
b <- x[, 1]
x <- x[, -1]
res <- clean_asset_bench_rf(x, b, rf = NULL, freq = "months",
